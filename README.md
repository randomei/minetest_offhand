# Offhand Items
This is a port of [mcl_offhand](https://github.com/MineClone2/MineClone2/tree/master/mods/HUD/mcl_offhand) for use with any other Minetest subgame.
Instead of using the offhand as a shield slot, this mod lets you use it for any item of your choice.
You can switch items between hands by pressing a configurable button (by default aux1 or E). When using a tool, press right-click to use the action of your offhand.
This lets you place torches and other nodes without having to put away your sword or pickaxe.
